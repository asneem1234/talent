GAIL’s strategy has been devised considering various assumptions for future Business
scenarios. Regulatory, Market and Price risk are inherent in the Oil & Gas industry globally
as well at National level due to geo-political and environmental issues. To understand the
risks due to such unpredictable scenarios, GAIL conducts regular Strategy revisit exercises.
This helps to keep the Strategy up to date while ensuring the mitigation of risks on Strategy
implementation. Risks are also reviewed by the Risk Management Committee (RMC), a
board level sub-committee of the Board.
Non-Compliance of Regulation 17(1)(b) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India LODR
Regulations, 2015 and Clause 3.1.1 and 3.1.4 of DPE Guidelines: The Company did not have
requisite number of Independent Directors during the period 16.05.2023 to 31.03.2024.
NSE and BSE had imposed an aggregate fine of ` 27,14,000/- for non-compliance. Moreover,
NSE and BSE had imposed an aggregate fine of ` 11,800/- on account of delay in submission
of disclosures of Related party transactions by one day.
GAIL being a PSE, the right to nominate/ appoint the Directors (including Independent
Directors) vests with the Government of India (MoP&NG). GAIL is regularly taking up with
MoP&NG on appointment of requisite number of Independent Directors. Hence the shortfall
in number of Independent Directors was not due to any negligence by GAIL and therefore
GAIL has requested NSE and BSE for waiver of fine. Further, due to technical issue in RPT
XBRL utility, GAIL could not file disclosures of related party transactions on due date of
 31st October, 2023 and could file the same on 1st November, 2023. Hence this delay was not
due to any negligence/default by GAIL but due to technical issues faced on NEAPS portal.

Inherent limitations in preparing the Assurance statement
• The preparation of the company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish objective targets or interpret the criteria with
respect to baseline data, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported information.
• The integrity of some data points could not be established as internal controls in collecting data and porting the same on SAP lacks
provisions of accountability, responsibility and approvals.
• GHG accounting process is not standardized at some sites as per ISO14064-1/2/3.
• Measurement of certain amounts of BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement
uncertainty, e.g. GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does
not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.
• Scope-3 GHG emissions is partially reported and limited to use of sold products & employee vehicles categories. Data is missing at some
sites.
• Biodiversity is reported only in terms of plantation.
• BRSR and E-sustainability module lacks capturing of some data points required for reporting.
• Awareness levels on BRSR requirement and assurance process including internal controls is lacking at ground level employees.
• We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement.
Our responsibilities
• Responsible for planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the disclosures in the BRSR. Verifying that
report is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the section

Reasonable Assurance opinion
We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement.
We designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance
opinion.
We obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the information subject to reasonable assurance in order to design procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. In carrying
out our engagement, we:
• assessed the data and disclosure by the company in preparing the reasonable assurance information.
• evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods used in the preparation of the information subject to
reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates made by the company; and
• evaluated the overall presentation of the information subject to reasonable assurance.
