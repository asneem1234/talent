Business Responsibility & Sustainability
Report
In May 2022, TCS became the first company to publish the
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) to
provide investors with enhanced disclosures about its ESG
practices. The BRSR framework is based on the National
Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) and
consists of three sections:
Section A provides a broad overview of the business, its
offerings, business and operations footprint, employees, related
parties, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and transparency.
Section B covers management and process disclosures related
to the businesses aimed at demonstrating the structures,
policies and processes put in place towards adopting the NGRBC
Principles and Core Elements.

and do not manufacture any physical products.
As the Company provides software services through its office-based operations, it procures off-the-shelf items or products, which

through waste minimization, segregation, reuse, recycling, and ecofriendly disposal according to regulatory requirements and
industry best practices.

Leadership Indicators
1. Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing industry) or for
its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?
No. This is not applicable to TCS. TCS does not have any physical products as a part of its offerings to customers. TCS is primarily
an IT services organization and products, if any, are typically software products. Hence the applicability of life-cycle approach
to TCS’ core operations is rather limited. Application of a life cycle approach is hence restricted to the services and products
procured by TCS for its own operations. Most of the product categories procured are off-the-shelf items. Hence, the life cycle
philosophy as extended to these include green procurement considerations as a part of the technical specifications for purchase

Essential Indicators
1. Details of total energy consumption (in Joules or multiples) and energy intensity, in the following format72:
Electricity from the grid is the most significant form of energy for TCS. Over the years, TCS has increased the share of Renewable
Electricity (RE) through “green-tariff” schemes offered by the state electricity providers, onsite rooftop solar generation and
procurement from third party producers in India. In certain countries, Energy Attribute Certificates (EAC) have been procured to
meet out carbon neutrality objectives in those geographies. The RE consumption as a percentage of total energy consumption has
increased from 55.2% in FY 2022-23 to 74% in FY 2023-24. Electricity consumption across TCS operations increased by
14.6% y-o-y on account of increased scale of operations in FY 2023-24 compared to previous year, due to more associates
returning to office. An inclusion of 14 locations globally in the reporting boundary during the current year attributed to a 2.8%
increase leading to an overall increase in electricity consumption. .
Other sources of energy include natural gas (mainly used for space heating/cooling, district heating and cooling, mostly in
overseas geographies), fuel used in company owned vehicles, cooking gas used in cafeteria and diesel used in diesel generators
(mainly used as a back-up source during power shortages).

8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details76.
Yes. TCS has taken up the target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon footprint by 70% by 2025 and become net
zero by 2030. To achieve these targets, the green-house gas management approach has four key levers – green infrastructure,
green IT, IT-enabled operational efficiencies, and renewable energy.
Commitment to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
In June 2022, TCS has responded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero
through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking
action - https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action. TCS is working on the next steps to developing company targets
for validation by SBTi.
Green Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:
All new campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have
roof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. The total Built Up Area occupied by TCS has increased
YoY from 36.6 Mn to 38.23 million sq.ft. in FY 2023-24. With the increasing footprint, TCS is committed to expand consciously its
green footprint, to align with its sustainability goals. In FY 2023-24, TCS got Platinum IGBC certification for 2 additional existing
buildings namely Sholinganallur, Chennai and Deccan Park, Hyderabad. The % green certified area over built up area was 64.6% in
FY 2022-23 and has increased to 67.3% this year. This accounts for 39 TCS offices and campuses with over 25.74 million sq.ft of
area under certified green building by Indian Green Building Council.
75 GRI 305-1; GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4. Scope 1 emissions have been calculated using the emissions factors published by the DEFRA conversion factors
2023. For Scope 2 emissions – for India, the source is the emission factor is the CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector, User Guide,
Version 19.0, December 2023, published by the Central Electricity Authority of India. This emission factor [(0.716 tCO2/ MWh) by CEA includes
the captive power injection into the grid and is adjusted for RE transactions through open access (in power exchanges)]. As TCS, India procures
electricity from the India grid, which is a mix of conventional and renewable energy, the emission factor of 0.716 tCO2/ MWh is considered more
appropriate. For Australia, Canada, North America, and UK emission factors specific to the region published by local authorities are used. For
other countries IEA v6 emission factors (01/2024) and GHG protocol v19 (04/2023) – eGRID 2021 have been used as appropriate to the source of
electricity procured. 76 GRI 305-5

During the year, several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT
infrastructure. Initiatives in building infrastructure included energy efficiencies in HVAC systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply
(UPS), and chillers.
• HVAC system upgradation by installation of latest technology VRF systems which works on inverter technology.
• Use of High Efficiency VFD based chillers.
• Replacement of R-22 based & fixed compressor-based HVAC equipment with inverter technology-based equipment
• Modular UPS which can modulate its capacity based on load and helps provide 90-95% efficiency, even at lower loads.
• Life cycle based replacement of HVAC equipment like chillers, pumps and cooling towers has helped reduce our energy
consumption.
• Energy optimization in our operations through iOT based solutions, remote monitoring, analytics and automated feedback
mechanism
• As our commitment to energy conservation and management, 2 additional campuses in India were certified to ISO
50001:2018 standards for Energy Management Systems (EnMS) in FY 2023-24, making it to a total of 22 campuses certified
to ISO 50001:2018 across TCS India.
Green IT:
Initiatives in green Information Technology (IT) focused on data center and IT device consolidation and optimization to reduce
the carbon footprint. The areas covered under green IT initiatives include IT energy optimization in data centers and equipment
rooms. TCS’ data centers at Yantra Park (Thane) and Siruseri (Chennai) have a weighted average PUE of 1.7. Apart from the two
main data centers, TCS also has 54 equipment rooms for business as usual (BAU) activities, wherein the weighted average PUE has
reduced from 1.88 in FY 2022-23 to 1.76 in FY 2023-24.
The data centre at Yantra Park uses 100% Renewable Energy (RE) while the one at Siruseri uses 73% RE. The power consumed by
the data centers at Yantra Park and Siruseri were 5.52 MWh and 1.65 MWh respectively during the reporting year FY 2023-24. In
addition to the above, green attributes are considered in every IT asset procurement.
TCS’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™) initiative involves real time monitoring to optimize
the operational energy efficiency across all offices. The smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe
Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone, enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and
facilities’ energy meters and sensors. Other energy optimization initiatives include:
• IT Equipment optimization (rack consolidation, server consolidation and procurement of energy efficient devices)
• UPS optimization (right sizing of UPS, replacement of old technology UPS with modular UPS)
• Cooling optimization (switching off excess capacity cooling units, maintaining return set temperature at 24 +/- 1 deg C,
replacing old with new technology cooling units)
• Leakage reduction (proper alignment of racks and perforated tiles, partitioning to reduce cooling area, cold aisle
containment, blanking panel, active tiles and soft partitioning
Renewable Energy:
The roof top solar photo voltaic installations this year remained at 10.2 MWp contributing to 3 percent of total electricity use in
FY 2023-24. A rooftop solar PV of 260 KWp has been planned for implementation in early FY 2024-25. The Company increased
its renewable energy procurement through a) switch over to green tariffs for its operations in Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai,
Kochi and Trivandrum branches, b) Green energy units procurement through Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) at two locations
in Chennai viz. Ambattur and Chennai One, Magnum, which cumulatively added about 6.5 million green units to the renewable
energy portfolio). The renewable energy procurement has resulted in an increase in renewable energy use to 74 percent of total
energy use.

9. Provide details related to waste management by the entity, in the following format77:
TCS being an IT services and consulting organization, TCS does not manufacture physical products and therefore do not use any
hazardous or toxic chemicals in core processes. The Company have office or facility operations, and the waste is generated from
the auxiliary processes used to run these facilities. Based on the nature of its services, TCS’ facilities mostly generate electronic,
electrical, and municipal solid waste. Potentially hazardous and regulated wastes such as lead-acid batteries and waste lube oil
are generated in relatively smaller proportions which are disposed through government-approved recyclers as per regulations.
E-waste is disposed to government approved e-waste recyclers.
TCS is committed to sustain the best practices that have already been institutionalized like segregation of all recyclable wastes,
100% compliance to management practices for regulated wastes like hazardous and e-waste and 100% recycling of office and
packaging paper and plastic. All TCS campuses, owned offices and leased offices that have available space are provided with
on-site food waste management facilities such as biodigesters and organic waste converters (OWCs) and garden waste is treated
by vermicomposting at TCS campuses where feasible. The company targets to maximize the recycling and reuse of all waste
categories to divert waste from landfill.
In FY 2023-24, TCS has obtained zero waste to landfill (ZWL) certification was obtained for TCS Deccan Park facility at Hyderabad
after having achieved a diversion rate of over 99% waste from landfill. This was done as a pilot project for feasibility.
TCS has operational control procedures (OCPs) for waste management and handling of different categories of wastes which is
available on the TCS intranet that has set procedures for waste segregation, handling, storage, and disposal of different waste
categories.

83 GRI 305-3, GRI 305-4; There are some inclusions and modifications in estimating scope 3 carbon emissions during FY 2024 when compared to FY
2023. Scope 3 emissions:
Category 1 & 2: Emission factors (spend based) for purchased and capital goods are taken from the latest available US EPA (Supply Chain GHG
Emission Factors for US Commodities and Industries v1.1.1) information for computer equipment, electrical equipment, office equipment,
vehicles, and furniture items. The US EPA emission factors for categories 1 & 2 were adopted in FY23 and used in FY24 as well. There is a
significant increase in Category 1 due to a new contract. Increase in category 2 is due to Return to Office (RTO)
Category 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned
vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category
since FY 2023 and the same has been continued in FY2024 as well. There is an increase in emissions due to use of IEA emission factors for WTT
and T&D in FY24. In FY23 the Company had used the DEFRA emission factors.
Category 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to other
supplies. While the Company continues to capture emissions from transportation of IT assets based on spend based emission factors, emissions
related to transportation of non -IT supplies were included. The non – IT supplies covered to estimate category 4 emissions include cafeteria/
canteen supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material, and other stationary supplies. Emission factors are taken from DEFRA
2023 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. There is a significant decrease in this category as the actual data were taken
from the locations in FY24 compared to FY23 which was based on pilot study at few locations. The Company has also moved the waste disposal
related transport emissions from Category 4 to 5 in FY24. .
Category 5: No change in approach in FY 2024. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different
categories of waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from
DEFRA 2023. Slight increase in emission due to increased RTO and also due to inclusion of waste disposal related transportation under this
category.
Category 6: In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail. In FY 2023 and FY 2024, business travel emissions also include hotel
stays at various geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2023. There is an increase in emissions due
to increase in business travel and accommodation due to resumption and RTO.
Category 7: In FY 2024, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees,
personal employee commute, public employee commute & work from home (WFH) emissions. There is an increase in employee commute due to
RTO in FY 2023-24 compared to previous year.

In our opinion, the company’s Identified Sustainability Information on pages 127 to 166 of the Annual
Report for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, subject to reasonable assurance is prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with the Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India
(SEBI) Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) and basis of preparation set out in
page 128 Section A: General Disclosures 13 of the Integrated Annual Report.
We do not express an assurance opinion on information in respect of any other information included in the
Integrated Annual Report 2024 or linked from the Sustainability Information or from the Integrated Annual
Report 2023, including any images, audio files or embedded videos.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial
Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our
report.
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics
for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA).
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services
Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a
system of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.
Other information
Additionally, we have performed a limited assurance engagement on select BRSR and GRI indicators and
issued an independent assurance report on 08 May 2024.
Our report thereon is included with the other information.
Our reasonable assurance opinion on the ISI does not extend to other information that accompanies or
contains the ‘ISI and our assurance report’ (hereafter referred to as “other information”). We have read the
other information, but we have not performed any procedures with respect to the other information.
Other matter
Select BRSR Core attributes of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2023 were assured by the
previous assurance practitioner who had expressed an unmodified opinion on 09 June 2023.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the
BRSR Core attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with
reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Responsibilities for the identified Sustainability Information (ISI)
The management of the Company acknowledge and understand their responsibility for:
• designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation of the ISI that is
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
• selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the ISI, taking into account applicable laws and
regulations, if any, related to reporting on the ISI, identification of key aspects, engagement with
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria;
• disclosure of the applicable criteria used for preparation of the ISI in the relevant report/statement;
• preparing/properly calculating the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria; and
• ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the intended users with relevant explanation;
• establishing targets, goals and other performance measures, and implementing actions to achieve such
targets, goals and performance measures;
• responsible for providing the details of the management personnel who takes ownership of the ISI
disclosed in the report;
• ensuring compliance with law, regulation or applicable contracts;
• making judgments and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances;

subject to assurance in accordance with the reporting criteria;
• preventing and detecting fraud;
• selecting the content of the ISI, including identifying and engaging with intended users to understand
their information needs;

• supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of the ISI
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the Company’s ISI.

Inherent limitations in preparing the ISI
The preparation of the company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the
criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to
substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy
footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty
in the amounts and metrics.
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
• Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability
disclosures in the BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,
in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the section above.
• Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we
have obtained, and
• Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Directors of Tata Consultancy Services Limited.
Exclusions
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a opinion on the same:
• Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
• Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
• Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.
• The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future
intentions provided by the Company.
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our opinion
We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement.
We designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.
Reasonable assurance opinion
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgment, including an
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the information subject to reasonable assurance, whether
due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement through understanding
the Information subject to reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also obtained an
understanding of the internal control relevant to the information subject to reasonable assurance in order to

design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of internal controls. In carrying out our engagement, we:
• assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the company in preparing the reasonable assurance
information;
• evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods and models used in the
preparation of the information subject to reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates
made by the company; and
• evaluated the overall presentation of the information subject to reasonable assurance.
